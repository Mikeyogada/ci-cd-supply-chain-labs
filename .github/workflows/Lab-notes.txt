LabB2 - Job Graph
DAG - Creates a workflow where job run sequentially by default. Here JobA runs then JobB runs in concurrence.

You can also enforce the order, by having needs: job-a


C. Trust Boundaries
C.1 Creating isolation workflow

Jobs runs in a clean,isolated environment, where no filesystem, memory or state are shared unless explicity passed to it.

Reason	              Explanation
🔐 Security	        Prevents one job from tampering with another
🔁 Reproducibility	Every job starts from known state
🧨 Blast radius	        Compromise is contained to a single job
🧪 Determinism	        No “it worked because a file existed


C.2 Workflow Config Trust Boundary
1. Try pushing workflow changes with limited token
 	- You need workflow PAT scope
	- Workflow Files are protected

WIth a wrong token, push was rejected, error indicated missing workflow scope and changes were blocked.

- Github treats workflow configuration as a higher-trust asset than normal code. CI config is priviledged control plane, not application code.

Reason: CI workflow files are like root access to your filesystem, a place where secrets are injected, engine of your pipeline.


Lab D - HOSTED RUNNER EPHEMERALLY
 Running a job on github defaults to a hosted runner, which starts and is recycled at the end of every job cycle. Once the job finishes, the runner is destroyed and files gone forever.

LAB E: ENVIRONMENTS

- in ci/cd environments, dev and prod are more of logical constraints than physical infrastracture.

Dev & Prod mean:
- Intent
- Rules
- Risk level
- Controls

An environment can define:
- Required approvals
- Secret scopes
- Deployment rules
- Protection policies
- Audit visibility

It does not define:
- What runner is used
- Where code is run

This seperation allows:
- Same code,different controls
- Same runner,different rules
- Strong governance without duplication

* A prod job does not automatically mean prod infra, it may mean higher trust expectations and stricter controls, unless youe explicitly define it.

LAB F2: Artefacts

* Jobs can share artefacts but cannot share files

Key lesson: Artefacts can be shared, and read across different jobs

LAB G2: Job Identity
Identities are scoped to jobs, each job has its own identity
- By deafult it has read permissions, and so cannot push
- Write needs to be explicitly declared
- Permissions: contents: write, permits a push


Key lesson: Identiy is job-scoped
