LabB2 - Job Graph
DAG - Creates a workflow where job run sequentially by default. Here JobA runs then JobB runs in concurrence.

You can also enforce the order, by having needs: job-a


C. Trust Boundaries
C.1 Creating isolation workflow

Jobs runs in a clean,isolated environment, where no filesystem, memory or state are shared unless explicity passed to it.

Reason	              Explanation
🔐 Security	        Prevents one job from tampering with another
🔁 Reproducibility	Every job starts from known state
🧨 Blast radius	        Compromise is contained to a single job
🧪 Determinism	        No “it worked because a file existed


C.2 Workflow Config Trust Boundary
1. Try pushing workflow changes with limited token
 	- You need workflow PAT scope
	- Workflow Files are protected

WIth a wrong token, push was rejected, error indicated missing workflow scope and changes were blocked.

- Github treats workflow configuration as a higher-trust asset than normal code. CI config is priviledged control plane, not application code.

Reason: CI workflow files are like root access to your filesystem, a place where secrets are injected, engine of your pipeline.
